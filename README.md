## 🧱 Features

### 1. ✅ Semantic Structure
Uses HTML5 semantic elements:

### 2. 📚 Clear Heading Hierarchy
Headings follow a logical order:
- `<h1>` – Website title
- `<h2>` – Section titles (About, Services, Contact)
- `<h3>` – Sub-section titles (within Services)

### 3. ♿ Accessibility Enhancements
Includes:
- `aria-label` attributes for better screen reader navigation
- `alt` text for images
- `label` elements correctly linked to form inputs using `for` and `id`
- Semantic form structure

### 4. 🔍 SEO-Friendly Metadata
`<head>` includes:
- `title` tag
- `meta name="description"`
